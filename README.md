# Power_Saver
A simple bash script that allow you to enable or disable the power saving mode of you computer.

I only tested this script on Fedora 36 wiht the Xfce environment  workstation.
You need to manually put the ID of your Network Card (it start with "wl" most of the time).

Useful if you are working on Ionis ;)
